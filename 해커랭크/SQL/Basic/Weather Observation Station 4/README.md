### 문제 설명

Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

The STATION table is described as follows:

<img width="300" height="290" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c29fce59-7aa7-453d-a8a0-af01b29b6d8b" />


where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. The query returns 1 , 

because total number of records - number of unique city names = 3 -2 = 1
